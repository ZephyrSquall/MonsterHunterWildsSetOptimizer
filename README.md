# Zephyr Squall's Monster Hunter Wilds Set Optimizer

This is a simple app I've written to help me search through all possible sets to find the one that
does the most damage. It's intended to be modular, so I can specify how often certain skills are
active with my playstyle, and I can specify specific comfort skills I want the build to include.

This is currently unfinished and not yet intended for use. If you want to use it anyway, note that
most skills are not properly implemented and treated as if they do nothing, so the results will not
be accurate.
